# Roll The Dice

Minimal React app (Parcel) that uses the provided `Dice` component.

Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This project uses SASS. If you don't have it, it's included in devDependencies and Parcel will compile `.sass` files automatically.

Files of interest:
- `src/Dice.js` — React component
- `src/Dice.sass` — styles (SASS)
- `src/App.js`, `src/index.js` — app entry points

Notes:
- This project uses Parcel (fast zero-config bundler). If you'd rather use Create React App or Vite, I can convert it.
